                    The staff at Stone Tree Estate will be wearing masks for the duration of the event. 
                    Guests are encouraged to wear masks around the food serving area to protect others, 
                    but can remove them to eat once seated at your tables. Masks will not be necessary in 
                    any of the outdoor areas, nor will they be required for dancing or sitting at the bar.
